### Recovery Tree.

OrangeFox device tree for Honor 7A (AUM-L29)
- To build OrangeFox, use branch Android 9, cuz this device has no dynamic partitions.
- Clone it to device/android/msm8937_64
- Also, clone <a href="https://github.com/TwrpBuilder/android_device_generic_twrpbuilder/">android_device_generic_twrpbuilder</a> with branch android-9.0 to device/generic/twrpbuilder
- Build with lunch `omni_msm8937_64-eng`.

If you don\`t want to clone it by yourself, just use my <a href="https://github.com/KrutosVIP/local_manifests">`local_manifests`</a>, with branch <a href="https://github.com/KrutosVIP/local_manifests/tree/msm8937_orangefox">`msm8937_orangefox`</a>
